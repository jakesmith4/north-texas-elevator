        <p>
          Routine and regular maintenance for your elevators may seem like an
          unnecessary expense. But if you really stop and think about it,
          scheduling regular service visits may actually save you time and
          money. Here’s why.
        </p>
        <h3>Optimal Functionality</h3>
        <p>
          As with most large, expensive equipment, regular maintenance is
          necessary to keep it functioning at its peak performance and to ensure
          that all pieces and parts continue working together for as long as
          possible. Most people wouldn’t dream of skipping oil changes, brakes,
          tires, belts, and other maintenance items on their cars. Elevators
          have oil, brakes, belts and rollers too! During regular maintenance,
          your service technician will keep everything lubricated and inspect
          and replace wear items. Waiting to do these things when the elevator
          stops working can cause major damage and require additional downtime
          and costly repairs. You could prevent a failure in the middle of the
          night or during the busiest rush of the day.
        </p>
        <h3>Ensure Safety and Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          Elevator equipment needs state required annual testing, and for
          certain types of equipment, 5 year testing in order to remain in
          compliance and to receive your certificate of operation. Murphy
          Elevator’s preventative maintenance programs include keeping your
          elevator’s state required testing up to date. Your service technician
          will also ensure your elevator is in compliance with state code
          requirements, routinely maintained, and free from issues that could
          cause breakdowns. Our maintenance plans include several levels of
          service to meet the needs of your equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regular maintenance also helps prevent common elevator malfunctions
          such as bad door operation, rough rides and poor leveling. Ensuring
          good leveling, smooth rides, and proper door operation keeps your
          building occupants safe from potential trip and fall hazards. These
          types of hazards are particularly dangerous to riders with poor
          mobility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building owners and managers should also be aware of new elevator
          mechanic licensing requirements. Many states require an elevator
          mechanics license to service and repair elevators. Every once in a
          while, we hear of building maintenance personnel or building
          electricians working on elevators as part of their job. It should go
          without saying that elevator work is extremely specialized and should
          only be attempted by trained professionals, regardless of state
          regulations. That said it is now in violation of the law in many
          states and could open up the building owner to serious liability.
        </p>
        <h3>Identify Need for Upgrades</h3>
        <p>
          As a building owner or property manager, you should know your
          elevators’ maintenance schedules. By keeping a detailed record of
          elevator service calls and the dates of maintenance, you can not only
          catch problems sooner, but you may also notice trends in malfunctions
          and downtime. An increase in service calls or decrease in parts
          availability could mean that it’s time for an upgrade or modernization
          of your elevators.
        </p>
        <p>
          How long has it been since your last upgrade? Discuss your options
          with your service technician and ask about your elevators’ life
          expectancy. It may be time to put an end to extensive spending to keep
          outdated parts working by overhauling your elevator and bringing it up
          to the latest technology.
