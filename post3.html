        <p>
          For property owners and managers of residential and office buildings
          with multiple floors, one big consideration is tenant satisfaction.
          And a huge aspect of that is how well your elevators function.
        </p>
        <h3>Happy Tenants Spread the Word</h3>
        <p>
          Your tenants don’t want to climb the stairs to their office, apartment
          or condo because of a broken elevator. For tenants with limited
          accessibility or a disability, a non-functioning elevator can mean
          having no access to their property. Every property manager knows that
          having just one elevator down in a group can fill the elevator lobby
          with people. Waiting too long to get back upstairs can set off even
          the best tenant.
        </p>
        <p>
          When tenants aren’t happy, they let you know. In today’s world, that
          can mean via social media or by posting negative reviews of your
          building online. All it takes is to have a potential resident do a
          simple search and find complaints to convince them to find a more
          modern, accessible building in which to live.
        </p>
        <h3>When to Consider Upgrading</h3>
        <p>
          f your building’s elevators experience frequent downtime, are too
          slow, or have rough or bumpy starts and stops, it may be time to
          consider some upgrades. By doing so, you’ll gain the love of your
          tenants and increase the likelihood that new prospective leaseholders
          will seek out your property for residence.
        </p>
        <h3>Modern Elevator Technology</h3>
        <p>
          Elevators today are far more efficient when it comes to moving people,
          but that doesn’t necessarily mean they are moving faster. Improved
          electronics mean that dispatching becomes more efficient. Modern
          elevators have microprocessors onboard that can “learn” a building’s
          traffic patterns and will dispatch elevators to the floors that are
          highest in demand during peak times.
        </p>
        <p>
          North Texas Elevator can perform a site survey on your property,
          measuring the speed, efficiency and overall performance of your
          elevators. We can then make recommendations on repair, refurbishment
          or replacement of your elevators and/or components.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our skilled, licensed technicians consider all elements that make your
          elevator user friendly. And we do our best to keep the safety and
          comfort of your tenants in mind as we do so. Schedule an inspection
          today.
