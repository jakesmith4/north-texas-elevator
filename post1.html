          One thing many property managers or owners don’t realize is that
          different types and classes of elevators are recommended for buildings
          depending on the size and types of loads they will be carrying.
          Smaller buildings with five or fewer stories usually require a
          hydraulic elevator. Taller buildings required a cabled elevator. In
          the elevator industry, these are called “traction elevators.”
        </p>
        <h3>Passenger Elevators</h3>
        <p>
          Passenger elevators are designed and rated for carrying passengers.
          Murphy Elevator can design passenger elevators in a variety of speeds
          and sizes. The largest passenger elevators have 10,000 lb capacity,
          although most haul between 2500 and 5000 lbs. Some are specially
          designed to accommodate stretchers, such as for hospital applications.
          They can be hydraulic or traction. They can also be machine room-less,
          which are essentially a specialized type of traction elevator. Read
          more on this in the MRL section below.
        </p>
        <h3>Freight Elevators</h3>
        <p>
          Freight elevators are heavy duty and designed to haul material.
          Freight elevators have vertically opening freight doors. Many older
          freight elevators have wooden gates that are opened manually. These
          types of elevators can be engineered to lift 20,000 pounds or more in
          special applications. Murphy has more than seven decades of experience
          in constructing freight elevators. We know the job these large lifts
          must do and can customize them based on the type of building you have
          and the loads they must carry. We can design freight elevators to meet
          any speed and size capacity your building requires.
        </p>
        <h3>Service Elevators</h3>
        <p>
          Service elevators are often mistakenly called Freight Elevators.
          Service elevators are actually regular passenger elevators that have
          been outfitted with utility cabs and floors, and are usually in an
          “employees only” area of a commercial building. The most common
          example would be the service elevator used by housekeeping in hotels.
          You can always tell the difference between service elevators and
          freight elevators because a freight elevator will have vertically
          opening “bi-parting” doors while service elevators will have normal
          side sliding doors. There are rare cases where service elevators can
          be classified and rated for freight loading, but this is the exception
          not the rule.
        </p>
        <h3>MRL Elevators</h3>
        <p>
          One of the latest innovations in the elevator arena are machine
          room-less elevators, or MRL elevators. Most MRL elevators are actually
          cabled traction passenger elevators. They utilize a small machine and
          motor at the top of the elevator shaft to move the unit with cables.
          By eliminating the machine room required by most elevators, you can
          achieve greater efficiencies in space planning. Due to their compact
          nature, MRL elevators must be used in applications with with 20
          stories or less and 5000 lbs. or less. MRL elevators can also be
          classified as passenger or freight elevators, but they are almost
          always passenger.
        </p>
        <h3>Commercial Elevators vs Residential Elevators</h3>
        <p>
          Residential elevators are designed for single family residences. If an
          elevator serves more than one residence, or if it is installed in any
          other type of building (church, office, etc), it must be a commercial
          elevator. There is a special less expensive type of commercial called
          LULA, which stands for “Limited Use Limited Application.” They are
          designed for low volume usage in buildings that need handicap
          accessibility. Churches and small condo buildings are common
          applications for LULAs. Residential elevators typically have a 500 or
          750 pound capacity.
        </p>
        <h3>Dumbwaiters</h3>
        <p>
          In residential homes, hotels, hospitals and even restaurants,
          dumbwaiters can be very practical. They can be installed in a small
          area and make moving meals, packages or other items between floors
          fast and easy. Murphy Elevator can create a custom dumbwaiter solution
          for your building to suit your exact needs.
